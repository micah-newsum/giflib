# giflib
This application is part of the [Spring with Hibernate](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/spring-with-hibernate) course at TeamTreeHouse. The original GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/treehouse/giflib-hibernate). The key differences between this version is that AdoptOpenJDK version 11 is used. Also, the Maven project manager tool is used instead of Gradle.
